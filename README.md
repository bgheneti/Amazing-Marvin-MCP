## 🎯 What is this?


This connects your [Amazing Marvin](https://amazingmarvin.com/) productivity system with AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and others. Instead of manually copying your tasks and projects into chat, your AI assistant can see and help with your actual Amazing Marvin data.

### ✨ Key Benefits

- 🔄 **Stay in sync** - Your AI assistant always sees your current tasks, projects, and goals
- 📋 **Smart help** - Get personalized advice based on your actual workload and priorities
- ⚡ **Save time** - No more copy-pasting task lists or explaining your projects
- 🎯 **Better focus** - AI helps you identify what's most important right now
- 🔒 **Private** - Your data stays between Amazing Marvin and your AI assistant

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Get your Amazing Marvin API key
1. Open Amazing Marvin → Settings → API (navigating [here](https://app.amazingmarvin.com/pre?api) may be easier on mobile)
2. Enable the API and copy your token
3. Keep this handy! 🔑

### Step 2: Install
**Easy way (Smithery):**
```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli mcp add @bgheneti/amazing-marvin-mcp --client claude
```
Paste the API key when prompted

**Alternative (pip):**
```bash
pip install amazing-marvin-mcp
```
Then add to your AI client config (see [installation guide](#-installation))

### Step 3: Verify it's working
Ask your AI: *"What tasks do I have today?"*

🎉 **That's it!** Your AI can now see your Amazing Marvin data.

## 💡 What can you do with this?

Once connected, your AI assistant becomes your personal productivity coach with access to your real Amazing Marvin data:

### 📅 Daily Planning Help
*"What should I focus on today?"* - Get personalized recommendations based on your actual deadlines and priorities

*"I'm feeling overwhelmed - what's most important?"* - AI helps you cut through the noise and identify what really matters

### 🎯 Project Insights
*"How is my website redesign project going?"* - See progress, completed tasks, and what's left to do

*"Show me everything related to client work this week"* - Get organized views of your tasks by project or category

### 📊 Progress Tracking
*"What did I accomplish this week?"* - Review your productivity patterns and celebrate wins

*"Which days am I most productive?"* - Understand your patterns to plan better

### ⏰ Smart Scheduling
*"What's overdue and needs attention?"* - Never lose track of important deadlines

*"Help me plan tomorrow based on what I have scheduled"* - Get realistic daily plans that work

### ⏱️ Time Tracking
*"Start tracking time on this task"* - Seamlessly manage time tracking from your AI chat

*"What have I been working on today?"* - Review your time allocation and focus

**Why this is better than generic productivity advice:** Your AI sees your actual tasks, deadlines, and progress - so the help you get is personalized to your real situation, not generic tips.

**Note:** This covers most Amazing Marvin features, though some advanced customizations and strategies have limited API access.

No need to explain your system - your AI just gets it!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Common Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>"API key not found" error</strong></summary>

**Problem**: The MCP can't find your API key.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your API key is correct in Amazing Marvin Settings → API
2. Check the environment variable: `echo $AMAZING_MARVIN_API_KEY`
3. Restart your AI client after setting the key
4. Ensure no extra spaces in your API key
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Connection refused" or timeout errors</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Can't connect to Amazing Marvin API.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify Amazing Marvin service status
3. Try the connection test: `python -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://serv.amazingmarvin.com/api').status_code)"`
4. Check if you're behind a corporate firewall
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>AI says "I don't see any Amazing Marvin data"</strong></summary>

**Problem**: MCP is running but not returning data.

**Solutions**:
1. Ask explicitly: *"Use the Amazing Marvin tool to get my tasks"*
2. Check if you have any tasks in Amazing Marvin
3. Verify API permissions in Amazing Marvin settings
4. Restart your AI client
</details>

<details>

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### 🛡️ Your Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: MCP runs entirely on your machine
- **Direct Connection**: Data goes directly from Amazing Marvin to your AI
- **No Cloud Storage**: Nothing is stored on external servers
- **API Key Security**: Store your key securely using environment variables

### 🔐 Best Practices
- ✅ Use environment variables for API keys (not config files)
- ✅ Don't share your API key in screenshots or logs
- ✅ Keep your API key secure and treat it like a password

### ⚖️ Performance & Limitations

**What to expect:**
- Your AI assistant fetches fresh data from Amazing Marvin when you ask questions
- Historical data is cached briefly to avoid repeated requests
- Response time depends on your internet connection to Amazing Marvin
- Very frequent requests might occasionally hit rate limits (just wait a moment)

**Technical details:**
- Data is fetched in real-time for accuracy
- Some data is cached for 10 minutes to improve speed
- Batch operations work efficiently for multiple tasks
- All the core Amazing Marvin features are supported
