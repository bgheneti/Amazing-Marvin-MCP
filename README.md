## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### 🛡️ Your Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: MCP runs entirely on your machine
- **Direct Connection**: Data goes directly from Amazing Marvin to your AI
- **No Cloud Storage**: Nothing is stored on external servers
- **API Key Security**: Store your key securely using environment variables

### 🔐 Best Practices
- ✅ Use environment variables for API keys (not config files)
- ✅ Don't share your API key in screenshots or logs
- ✅ Keep your API key secure and treat it like a password

### ⚖️ API Limitations & Rate Limiting

**Rate Limiting:**
- Amazing Marvin API has rate limits on requests per minute
- The MCP makes API calls as needed for each request
- Historical data is cached for 10 minutes to reduce API load
- Rate limit errors (429) may occur with frequent requests

**API Endpoint Characteristics:**
- `/doneItems`: Provides completed tasks, can be filtered by date
- `/todayItems`: Returns scheduled tasks for the current day
- `/children`: Returns tasks belonging to a specific parent/project
- `/categories`: Returns projects and categories
- Data must be fetched through specific endpoints - no bulk data export

**Performance Optimization:**
- Historical data is cached for 10 minutes (except today's data)
- Multiple API calls may be required for comprehensive queries
- Batch operations are available for task creation and completion
- Cache is cleared after 1 hour of inactivity
